# Hardware

Repository of hardware designs for Detector Lab work. All designs when possible should be done using Autodesk Inventor 2019 or earlier.

Any shop jobs, based on these designs or otherwise, must have an accompanying work order in `Work Orders/`. Start with the appropriate blank form (found in `Work Orders/`), then include your and your supervisor's contact into, the date, and a short description of the job. Export the form as a PDF and upload it to the repository. Next, create an Issue in this repository with a more detailed description of the job. Add any relevant tags to the issue and assign it to the correct project. When the job is finished, resolve the issue.

Work order forms should follow the following naming convention: `YYYY_MM_{PROJECT}_{DESC}.pdf`
